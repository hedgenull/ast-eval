I started this late. So, at the time of writing (Jul. 21, 2022, at 6:37 PM), I already have:
- numbers
- strings
- math
- booleans
- if-expressions
- rudimentary string formatting

I plan to add functions next. Functions will be expressed in this form:
`x = (a, b) => (a + b)`

They'll be called like this:
`x(1, 2) # evaluates to 3`
