I started this late. So, at the time of writing (Jul. 21, 2022, at 6:37 PM), I already have:
- numbers
- strings
- math
- booleans
- if-expressions
- rudimentary string formatting
- comments
- constants
- variables

I plan to add functions next. Functions will be expressed in this form:
`x = (a, b) => (a + b)`

They'll be called like this:
`x(1, 2) # evaluates to 3`

I also want to add macros, similar to the ones in C:
`macro and => &&` will allow 'and' to be used in place of the and operator, '&&'.
I might have more advanced regex macros, like this:
`remacro "new object (IDENT) : (VALUE)" => "\1 = \2"`, which would let variables be defined as `new object my_var: my_value`.
