I started this late. So, at the time of writing (Jul. 21, 2022, at 6:37 PM), Echo* already has:
- numbers
- strings
- math
- booleans
- null
- if-expressions
- rudimentary string formatting
- comments
- constants
- variables
- arrays

Right now, built-in functions like `print` are nonoperational. That means that for the time being, and since Echo* will probably never be a big, popular language, `print` might be a keyword instead of a function. Gross, I know, but I think it's necessary, since printing is kind of an important thing for a programming language.


I plan to add functions. Functions will be expressed in this form:
```
x = (a, b) => (a + b)
```

They'll be called like this:
```
x(1, 2) # evaluates to 3
```

I also kinda want to add macros, similar to the ones in C, just for fun. For example:
`macro and => &&` will allow 'and' to be used in place of the and operator, `&&`.
