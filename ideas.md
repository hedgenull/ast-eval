I plan to add functions. Functions will be expressed in this form:
```
x = (a, b) => (a + b)
```

They'll be called like this:
```
x(1, 2) # evaluates to 3
```

I also kinda want to add macros, similar to the ones in C, just for fun. For example:
`macro and => &&` will allow 'and' to be used in place of the and operator, `&&`.
